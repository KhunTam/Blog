          <h3 id="CHARGING-TOWARD-THE-BEGINNING-OF-CHEMICAL-REACTION"><a href="#CHARGING-TOWARD-THE-BEGINNING-OF-CHEMICAL-REACTION" class="headerlink" title="CHARGING TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF CHEMICAL REACTION"></a>CHARGING TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF CHEMICAL REACTION</h3><p>The first consideration roasters must make when I approaching the beginning of the roast is considering the charge temperature and charge weight of the batch they will be loading into the roaster. Charge temperature indicates the initial heat value of the drum as read by the return air (exhaust air) probe on the roaster. This is not a precise measurement of the total temperature, simply an approximation of the temperature of the air after it has passed through the roasting drum (ideally, indicating the heat of the air after either depositing heat into or being heated by the metal in the roasting drum). One will need to modify the charge temperature up or down for the following reasons: batch size, batch number of the day, anticipated residual heat in the roasting system, and desired heat application in the roast.</p>
<p>Typically, a smaller charge weight will call for a lower charge temperature, and heavier weight will call for a higher temperature. Usually, the greater the batch number for the day, the lower the required charge temperature (because of thermal retention). Additionally, if you just roasted a dark roast coffee, you will likely need a lower charge temperature for the following batch because of higher heat retention in the system. Depending on the roast profile of the coffee you are trying to roast (especially compared with the power output of your roaster), you may need a higher &#x2F; lower charge temperature in order to achieve the necessary rate of rise (or modify your batch size slightly). The bottom line is, charge temperature and charge weight will help the roaster establish the initial thermal momentum of the roasting environment.</p>
<p>Another important indicator is your turn-around point. The turn-around point is a piece of roast data that, while not a precise measurement, gives the roaster a grasp of what is happening with the rate of heat transfer early in the roast. In a roast profile, the turn-around point represents the bean probe’s rate of rise hitting zero after sharply dropping for the first minute or so (results will vary based on thermocouple type, thickness, and placement). At the beginning of the roast, the bean probe is heated roughly to the environmental temperature of the drum. When you add the room-temperature beans into the roaster (i.e. charge the roaster), the bean probe readout begins to drop sharply. At the same time (though we cannot see it in any readouts), the bean temperature is sharply rising from room temperature to meet the thermocouple as it declines. The turn-around point is the measurement of when and at what temperature the beans rise in temperature equalizes with the thermocouple’s declining temperature, after which the two rise together (called “turn- around,” “equilibrium,” or “delta point”). The timing of the turn-around can help you understand the momentum of the roast long before getting a true Rate of Rise (RoR) from the bean temperature thermocouple. If the turn-around happens earlier than planned, you are entering the roast with more thermal momentum than you may have expected and should lower your heat application. This can also be true if the thermocouple temperature reads abnormally high. If the turn-around happens significantly later than it should, then you are probably lacking in thermal momentum and should use slightly higher than normal heat application. Similarly, if the temperature for turn-around is lower than normal, it may behoove you to use greater heat application in order to meet the planned profile.</p>
<p>Though charge weight&#x2F; temperature and turn-around time&#x2F; temperature do not directly cause flavor development in the roast specifically, they significantly affect the rest of the roast. These factors do not have to be held in total constant in order to match a roast profile or match flavor development; rather, the craft and skill of the roaster manipulates them to maintain heat application in the early stages of the roast.</p>
<p>After charging the roaster with beans, the thermocouple drops rapidly in temperature until equalizing with the constant rise of the bean temp at a bean temperature probe RoR of 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The readout then begins to rise right along with the average surface temperature of the bean mass (and air), as free moisture begins to be driven off the bean. For lack of better terminology, I often refer to this as the drying phase. There are no real significant chemical reactions happening; rather, water vapor is being driven off, pressure is beginning to build and the thermal momentum of the batch is being established. As enough moisture is driven off the bean, chemical reactions can begin and color changes (specifically pale green&#x2F;white to yellow) become visible on the surface of the coffee bean. This color change is one of the first critical points of measurement. Note the temperature at which the bean becomes yellow in your roaster and try to use that thermocouple measurement to standardize your notations. Noting the time and temperature of the beginning of chemical reaction is absolutely critical to understanding development and helping to replicate that roast at a later time.</p>
<p>Quick notes about this segment of the roast:</p>
<p>The “drying phase,” for lack of a better term, begins at the charge of the roast and ends at the critical point noted as the beginning of chemical reaction. This point is noted as the beginning of color change to yellow and adoption of hay-like aroma. This signals the beginning of the Maillard reaction and the measurement of our next critical segment.</p>
<p>Matching time from charge through drying to this point with other batches of this coffee at this curve will help develop consistent thermal energy for chemical reaction phases and make your job as the roaster operator much easier.</p>
<p>If you know through experience that this coffee does not develop roast defects if it is allowed to “dry” (i.e. drive off free moisture) until this point (x amount of time allows for proper drying without causing roast defects), then it will help to safeguard against negative flavor contributors like scorching and tipping.</p>
<p>Tipping is caused by excessively rapid heat application; scorching is caused by too high of a drum surface temperature during the charge of the roast. It causes a toasty, grainy, burnt flavor.</p>
<p>Facing is another defect, in which coffee that has already gone through color change is scorched. It may happen due to drum speed (centrifugal force), drum overloading, or too high a rate of conductive heat transfer. Facing causes burnt and char like characteristics in the cup.</p>
<p>If the time from the charging of the roast to the beginning of chemical reaction is too short, then the development of roasting defects like scorching and tipping are more likely.</p>
<p>In addition, a shortened time frame will result in unevenly driven off moisture, creating the potential for some inconsistencies in the development of the flavors in the coffee.</p>
<p>If this time is too fast, then you may have too much energy within the roasting system and will experience a “runaway” curve that does not enable you to meet future goal times and temperatures for your roast curve.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the time from the charging of the roast to the beginning of chemical reaction is too long, it could result in a lack of pressure within the bean during chemical reactions, which will result in deficient flavor development in the coffee (i.e. a flat coffee).</p>
<p>An elongated drying time could result in a lack of thermal V momentum in the roaster and make it impossible for you to achieve a solid match for the rest of the roast curve you have planned.</p>
<p>Take care during the drying time, as you are not only trying to avoid certain flavor defects stemming from roasting defects (tipping, scorching), you are also trying to set yourself up for success later in the roast.</p>
<p>This first notation (beginning of chemical reaction) along the path of the roast curve is not directly a control point to cause the development of positive flavors; rather, it is a control point to help aid in the avoidance of negative flavor contributions. Additionally, since this helps to further establish thermal momentum in the roasting system, it indirectly causes the development of certain other flavor contributors based on the fluctuations in the later roast curve caused during this time. It is critical to understand your roasting system well through a little trial and error (or expert advice) in order to determine optimum charge temperatures, turn-around points and overall heat application to achieve ideal results for the “drying phase” of roasting. The number of variables for each unique situation are too great for me to cover; in this volume.</p>
<h3 id="MAILLARD-REACTION"><a href="#MAILLARD-REACTION" class="headerlink" title="MAILLARD REACTION"></a>MAILLARD REACTION</h3><p>“A remarkable scheme of the Maillard reactions has been proposed by Hoge (1953, 1967) who gives clear information on the mechanisms of this non-enzymatic browning reaction. Nursten (1981) proposed a classification system of the Maillard reaction products: (i) ‘simple’ sugar dehydration&#x2F;fragmentation products (furans, pyrones, cyclopentenes, carbonyl compounds, acids); (ii) ‘simple’ amino-acid degradation products (aldehydes, sulfur compounds); (iii) volatiles produced by further interactions (pyrroles, pyridines, imidazoles, pyrazines, oxazoles, thiazoles, compounds from aldol condensations).”4</p>
<p>The Maillard reaction is one of the most chemically complex reactions that occurs during coffee roasting. It more than doubles the number of volatile aromatic compounds present in the coffee compared to the initial volatile aromatic compounds in green coffee as well as produces a number of critical intermediate and final products. This chemical reaction begins early in the roast as amino acids act as catalysts with reducing sugars, resulting in a complex non-enzymatic sugar- browning process. As expressed by Andrea Illy and Rinantonio Viani, “Water and carbon dioxide are generated by the very important Maillard reaction, which leads to the coloured products, the melanoidins, and to the main part of the organic volatiles.”5 These continue to change, react, change, and react, creating a number of intermediate products as well as different chemical compounds. For our purposes we will be considering the beginning of color change to yellow to indicate the beginning of the Maillard reaction. This chemical reaction will continue until it either runs out of compounds with which to react, or is ended by the drop of the roast into the cooling tray (though it will continue until the coffee is decently cooled; this is one of the reasons why it is super important to have an effective cooling tray).</p>
<p>Though this reaction continues until the end of the roast, it is not productive for us to measure it, since we are concerned about a number of different roast phases. Thus, we will be measuring it from the beginning of color change to the beginning of first crack. Taking into account the vast array of volatile aromatic compounds created during this stage, in my mind some of the more important compounds that are created are the melanoidins. There has been research into the “…flavor binding, color, texture, and antioxidant properties of melanoidins and investigation of the physiological effects and fate of melanoidins (COST, 2002).”6 In my opinion, the greatest contributions have to do with flavor, and texture (think body). As the Maillard reaction continues, it generates more and more melanoidins, which continue to modulate the complexity and perceived body of the coffee (they have a high molecular weight, which correlates with higher viscosity and thus thicker mouth-feel). By lengthening the roast during this phase, you can increase the perception of complexity and body (and modulate the way we perceive the flavors). By decreasing the time that the Maillard reaction is permitted to occur, you can decrease the body and improve the clarity of the coffee.</p>
<p>Quick notes about this segment (I call MAI) of the roast:</p>
<p>The measurement of this segment of the Maillard Reaction begins at the initial color change point noted above.</p>
<p>This measurement ends when you can tell that the bulk of the coffee in the roaster is beginning to enter first crack (the audible demonstration of sugar caramelization).</p>
<p>The duration of the Maillard reaction is significant because this reaction will continue to occur until either the roast is ended or it runs out of reactants.</p>
<p>The Maillard Reaction is caused by amino acids acting as catalysts with reducing sugars, this chemical reaction continues to produce intermediate products, which it then reacts with to produce other intermediate products.</p>
<p>This chemical reaction is likely responsible for well over 600 volatile organic compounds within the finished product.</p>
<p>In addition, this reaction continuously produces melanoidins. These high-molecular-weight browning products contribute flavor, body&#x2F;texture, color, bonding and complexity to the coffee. Specifically to our experiments, they greatly modulate the experience of the body of the coffee.</p>
<p>If you increase the amount of time that the Maillard reaction is allowed to occur, you increase the complexity of the sugar browning tones you are creating in addition to the weight&#x2F;texture&#x2F;mouth-feel.</p>
<p>Ex. Brown sugar turns to maple syrup turns to honey&#x2F; vanilla turns to molasses</p>
<p>Though the specifics are different with every coffee (i.e. some just will never have a honey-like tone or a vanilla bean in the finish), this modulation of flavor holds true with all coffees.</p>
<p>When considering how to modulate this part of the roast curve, you should consider what you taste in the cup, and then think about the human experience of taste. Ask what a heavier mouth-feel would do to this coffee, or what greater complexity could add or subtract from the experience you are trying to craft. Also, consider how the heavier mouth- feel (viscosity) and the increased complexity affect the clarity of the beverage.</p>
<p>In disclosing some detail about how I arrived at my conclusions, I would like to share some of my cupping scores for a variety of experimental coffees in order to help the reader understand the potential effects of altering the Maillard time. In these experiments, I will talk about the differences made in the following coffees: a Brazilian Micro-lot, a Mexican Organic, a SHG Guatemalan, and an Ethiopian Kochere. All of these cuppings were done blind in our cupping lab at Nossa Familia Coffee in Portland, Oregon. For these particular experiments, I held the drying time, development time, and final temperature as constant as I could (aiming for less than 10 second deviations) and manipulated only the time spent ‘ in the Maillard-to-first-crack (MAI) phase. In the body score, I am listing the qualitative (horizontal) score first (6-10) and following that with an intensity score (1-5).</p>
<p>Brazil Micro-lot Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 8 | 3 0:00 Honeyed with clove, ginger, and cinnamon, cherry flesh.</p>
<p>Fast MAI 7.5 | 2 -0:10 Cherry, with a seed-like savory spice, pie cherries and graham cracker, floral, chocolate, slight merlot grape, brown sugar, significantly less body.</p>
<p>Slow MAI 8.5 | 3 +0:39 Plum, seed like, sweet, herbaceous spices, drinking chocolate, dark cherries, floral and fragrant, merlot grape with heavy body.</p>
<p>Brazilian Micro-lot: In this experiment(my first), I tried to hold all things constant with the exception of my time between color change and the beginning of first crack. Though I was almost completely successful, I had one roast that fell out of specification, yet helped to highlight the points I am making here. Considering baseline time as 0:00 for Maillard reaction, the faster Maillard reaction varied by -0:10, and the slower Maillard reaction by +0:39 (the out-of-spec-for-development- time experiment was +0:35). With the baseline roast, I noticed the following: decent body (qualitatively an 8 on SCAA form) with a 3 for intensity of body. Descriptors I used for this coffee included chocolate, honeyed, clove, tea-like, notes of cherry flesh and cinnamon spices, balanced. The faster time for Maillard reaction was a 7.5 qualitatively and a 2 with regard to intensity. Descriptors I used for this coffee were cherry, soft floral, seed-like, graham cracker, very light-bodied. Meanwhile, my scores for the longer Maillard reaction were an 8.5, and a 3 with regard to intensity. Descriptors I used were plum, herby spices, drinking chocolate, dark cherry, heavy-bodied. Finally, since it is relevant to this discussion, the accidental modulation of the “out of spec” roast resulted in a 7.5 qualitative analysis, and a 4 with regard to the intensity of the body. Descriptors used were chocolate, honeyed, and candied plum. There was also a note about the heaviness of the body. There seems to be a clear trend in this coffee to the modulation of a heavier body (and in this particular case, a more pleasing qualitative analysis) with the increase in duration of the Maillard reaction. Additionally, there is a change in the descriptors moving toward “heavier” and more complex taste descriptors.</p>
<p>Organic Mexican Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 7.5 | 3.5 0:00 Sweet, caramel, rich red berries, floral, graham cracker, red apple.</p>
<p>Fast MAI 7.5 | 4.5 -0:08 Sweet nut, perfumed floral, spice, molasses, chocolate, green grape to apple.</p>
<p>Slow MAI 8 | 5 +0:26 Sweet, chocolate, brown sugar, fruit, warming spice in aftertaste.</p>
<p>The Mexican Organic coffee displayed encouragingly similar results despite differences in variety, altitude, processing method and microclimate. The baseline once again is represented by 0:00. This time, the faster reaction is represented by -0:08, and the longer reaction time by +0:26. The baseline roast of this coffee scored as follows: 7.5 qualitative, and 3.5 with regard to intensity. Descriptors used on this coffee include sweet caramel, rich red berries, floral, graham cracker, and red apple. The faster of the reactions scored the following: 7.5 qualitative with a 4.5 intensity. Though this doesn’t match with the proposed effects, the rest of the data would make this out to be an erroneous score (I am only human). Also, the variance is under 0:10, which is part of the reason I developed a 0:10 consistency standard. (I have trouble tasting variance if it is within 10 seconds, so when production roasting I only consider variances of less than 0:10 to be on target). The descriptors used for this one include sweet nut, perfumed, floral, spice, green grape to apple. The longer Maillard reaction yielded an 8 on the body with an intensity of 5. Cupping notes for this coffee included sweet chocolate, brown sugar, fruit. Notice that once again we have not only a shift in the intensity toward heavier body as we progress through a longer Maillard reaction pre-first crack, but there is also a shift in the descriptors toward weightier and more complex flavors.</p>
<p>Thirdly (and fourthly) is the experimentation with the SHG Guatemalan. Let’s deal with the first round, and then we will move over to the second. During the first round, baseline was 0:00, faster reaction was -0:29, and longer reaction was +0:23. Please note I cupped this coffee 7 times, and this is a representation of the average scores for these coffees. Baseline scored 7.75, with a 2.75 intensity. Cupping notes for the coffee included sweet, citric, peach, floral, vanilla, white tea, raw sugar, baking spice. The faster Maillard scored a 7 and an intensity of 2.5. Cupping notes for this coffee included dull, sweet, bland, floral, peach-like, spices, seed-like, caramel. The longer Maillard reaction scored 7.625, and 3.5 with regards to intensity. Cupping notes used to describe this coffee included floral, vanilla, peach, baking spices, baked peaches, cinnamon, honeyed, chocolaty, tobacco, peach pie, mulled spices, coriander seed. In this example we see again a trend toward increase in intensity of the body, alteration of qualitative scores, and a modulation of descriptors from simple to complex, and from light to heavy.</p>
<p>SHG Guatemalan A Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 7.75 | 2.75 0:00 Sweet, citric, peach flesh, vanilla, White tea, floral, lime, molasses.</p>
<p>Fast MAI 7 | 2.5 -0:29 Sweet nut, perfumed floral, spice, molasses, chocolate, green grape to apple.</p>
<p>Slow MAI 7.625 | 3.5 +0:23 Fruity, floral, vanilla, peach, baking spices, vanilla, cinnamon, honeyed, chocolate, tobacco, heavy, darker peach tones, mulled spices, molasses, baked peaches.</p>
<p>SHG Guatemalan B Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 7.75 | 2.75 0:00 Peach pie, tea-like floral tones, pie spices, molasses and honey (hints of caramel).</p>
<p>Fast MAI 7 | 2.5 -0:29 Peach preserves, cherry, hints of floral, cinnamon, clove, herbaceous spices, caramel chocolate, syrupy.</p>
<p>Slow MAI 7.625 | 3.5 +0:23 Fruity peach (ripe), tea like, heavy floral tones, slight seed like and tea like characters, honey like sweetness, very syrupy.</p>
<p>The second set of experiments with the SHG Guatemalan resulted as follows. Baseline 0:00, faster reaction was -0:03, longer reaction was +0:41. Baseline scored 8.5 with regard to quality and a 3.5 with regard to intensity. Descriptors included peach pie, tea-like floral, molasses, honey and caramel, floral tones. The faster Maillard reaction time scored an 8 for qualitative and a 4 for intensity. Similar to the experiment with the Mexican, we have what appears to be an outlier, but the differentiation is minimal and can be accounted for by the slightly longer length in development time. The tasting notes for this roast were peach preserves, hint of cherry, floral, cinnamon, clove, chocolate, molasses. The scores for the longer Maillard reaction time were an 8 qualitative and a 2.5 for intensity. This is an outlier in the true sense of the word. I can theorize as to its presence, but I am better off just admitting the flaws in my cupping and indicate to the reader that, despite this outlier, I still fully believe in the aforestated trending and utilize it to this day. Tasting notes of this roast were fruited, ripe peach, tea-like, heavy floral, honey and graham cracker, syrupy. There seems to be a slightly similar trend to the descriptors despite the variation in the cupping scores.</p>
<p>Kochere - Ethiopian Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 7.5 | 2 0:00 Floral, white tea, honey, citrus, lemon, berry, vanilla, butterscotch, bergamot.</p>

<p>Body Score σ from Baseline Notes</p>
<p>Baseline 7.5 | 4.5 0:00 Floral, white tea, honey, citrus, lemon, berry, vanilla, butterscotch, bergamot.</p>
<p>Fast MAI 7.5 | 2 -0:11 Lemon, floral, vanilla, slight seed-like character, cinnamon, orange, orange rind, floral, bergamot.</p>
<p>Slow MAI 7.5 | 3 +0:54 Chocolate, floral, nut, citrus blossom, malt, sweet lemon meringue, berries, lemon bar, caramel, vanilla.</p>
<p>Finally, my experiments with the Ethiopian Kochere. This one provides us with a particularly rich glance into the development occurring in the Maillard reaction from beginning of color change to the beginning of first crack because in addition to the dedicated experimental data, I have data from a number of production runs with slight variations in Maillard reaction length. We’ll begin with the experiment, and then I will branch out into discussing the other sets of data. Baseline 0:00, faster development -0:11, and slower development +0z54. Baseline scores a qualitative 7.5 (7.5 second cupping) with a quantitative 2 (4.5 second cupping).</p>
<p>The cupping notes for this roast are floral, white tea, honey, citrus, lemon, vanilla, butterscotch, and bergamot. For the faster reaction time, the coffee scored 8 (7.5) and a 3.5 (2) for intensity. Cupping notes for this coffee were lemon, floral, vanilla, seed, baking spice, orange rind. Finally, the longer Maillard reaction development scored an 8 (7.5) for quality and a 3 (3) for intensity. The tasting notes for this expression of the coffee were chocolate, floral, nut, citrus blossom, malt, sweet lemon, lemon meringue, caramel, and vanilla. As with the other coffees, you can see a clear progression in terms of complexity, and weight of flavors as well as a trend within the scoring.</p>
<p>With the Kochere specifically, I logged a number of intentional variances in our production roasts. By pairing these with cupping notes reflecting not the SCAA form interpretation but the flavor modulation, we can see a clear picture beginning to develop. In this extensive listing of Maillard times with regard to the baseline, a trend in flavor descriptors becomes apparent. Flavor moves from less structured toward complex, and from lighter in weight&#x2F;body to heavier.</p>
<p>Time Relative to Baseline</p>
<p>Flavor Profile</p>
<p>-1:12 Cane sugar, honey, vanilla</p>
<p>-1:05 Honey-like</p>
<p>-0:59 Sweet honey, vanilla</p>
<p>-0:51 Caramel, molasses, a lot of vanilla, buttery</p>
<p>-0:49 Wild honey, vanilla, syrupy</p>
<p>-0:44 Cane sugar, honey, vanilla</p>
<p>-0:40 Cocoa nibs, honey, Wild honey</p>
<p>-0:36 Cane sugar, agave nectar, buttery, vanilla bean</p>
<p>-0:25 Caramel, vanilla bean</p>
<p>-0:16 Cinnamon, butter, vanilla, baking spices</p>
<p>0:00 Honey-like, vanilla, butterscotch</p>
<p>+0:48 Chocolate</p>
<p>+0:53 Chocolate, malt, caramel, vanilla bean</p>
<p>At its core, this chart demonstrates the basis of my understanding of the role of the Maillard reaction in the roasting of coffee. It increased the complexity of chemical composition and the perception of body, resulting in the appropriate modulation of the perceived flavor for the coffee drinker. In other words, you could intentionally give a coffee a tea-like structure, or a caramel-like mouth-feel, or give it a heavy, buttery body all by modulating the length of time the Maillard reaction is permitted to generate melanoidins.</p>
<p>Even so, there is no silver bullet here. Each coffee has within it a slightly different chemical composition that will cause it to have different flavors and potential for flavors. But in the end, they all will trend in the way I have suggested. As a roaster, you have a great amount of control in how you will present the coffees (what you are accentuating and what you are downplaying), but you only have so much latitude. In order to land on certain flavor profiles, you must be diligent and deliberate in your sourcing strategies and then use these roasting strategies to draw out that potential.</p>

<p><strong>The “Arrow Model” of Focus</strong></p>
<p>Epinephrine&#x2F;adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine work together to facilitate the ability to  get focused, direct focus, and stay focused over time.<br>肾上腺素（Epinephrine&#x2F;adrenaline ）能增加能量和警觉性（但不足以让你集中注意力），而乙酰胆碱（  Acetylcholine ）则能将注意力集中在某个特定的点上，最后多巴胺（Dopamine）则是能让注意力更加持久。</p>
<p><strong>Tool: Binaural Beats to Improve Concentration</strong></p>
<p>Dr Andrew Huberman 推荐可以在工作或学习之前，听 5 分钟 40Hz 的Binaural Beats，这种声音已被证明可以增加认知、放松、创造力、减轻疼痛、减轻焦虑。</p>
<p><strong>Tool: White, Brown &amp; Pink Noise, Transition to Focused State</strong></p>
<p>白噪音、棕噪音以及粉噪音能帮助你更好地进入集中注意力的状态。但需要注意，这些噪音能帮助你持续工作 45 分钟左右，但不是连续工作几小时。另外这个方法Dr Andrew Huberman 自己并不怎么用，但据研究这个方法的确是有效的。</p>
